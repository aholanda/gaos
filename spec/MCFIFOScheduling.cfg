CONSTANTS
  Snd <- MCSnd
  Get <- MCGet
  InitTaskInt <- MCInitTaskInt
    \* These declarations tell TLC to substitute MCSnd for Snd,
    \* MCGet for Get, and MCInitProcInt for InitProcInt.

  Task = {t1, t2, t3}
    \* This tells TLC to let Proc be a set consisting of the 
    \* uninterpreted constants.

  CPU = {c1}
    \* This tells TLC to let CPU be a set consisting of the
    \* uninterpreted constants.

  NoTask = NoTask
    \* TLC cannot handle the unbounded CHOOSE in the definition
    \* of NoTask.
