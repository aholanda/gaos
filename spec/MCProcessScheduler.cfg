CONSTANTS
  Snd <- MCSnd
  Get <- MCGet
  InitProcInt <- MCInitProcInt
    \* These declarations tell TLC to substitute MCSnd for Snd,
    \* MCGet for Get, and MCInitProcInt for InitProcInt.

  Proc = {p1, p2, p3}
    \* This tells TLC to let Proc be a set consisting of the two
    \* uninterpreted constants p1, p2 and p3.

  CPU = {c1, c2}
    \* This tells TLC to let CPU be a set consisting of the two
    \* uninterpreted constants a1 and a2.
